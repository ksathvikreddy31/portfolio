      <p>
        Hello! I'm K. Sathvik Reddy, a passionate and curious Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at CMR College of Engineering and Technology. I love turning innovative ideas into impactful projects by combining smart algorithms with clean and practical design.
        With experience in building real-time applications like Face Mask Detection and Nirva-Agni (an AI-based fire detection and suppression system), I enjoy exploring the intersection of hardware and AI. Iâ€™ve participated in multiple hackathons such as IET Karmaveer, HackSavvy, and Ideothon, where I got the opportunity to pitch and build tech solutions under pressure.
        From full-stack development to AI-driven systems, I strive to create meaningful and efficient solutions. My goal is to keep learning, building, and contributing to real-world problems with technology.
